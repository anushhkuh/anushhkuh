# Hello world !

Hello World!  My name is Anushka - and this Barbie is an aspiring AI engineer ðŸ©·, and this is my canvas where I am constantly planning, developing, improving. 
My interests are coding, understanding what's new this week in tech, reading books, painting and watching horror movies. 

I fluently speak Python, C++ and have immense interest in LLMs, AI agents and AGI and knowing what the future holds for the tech industry.
