# Hello world !

Hi!  My name is Anushka and this Barbie is an aspiring Software engineer ðŸ©·, and this is my canvas where I am constantly planning, developing, improving. 
My interests are coding, understanding what's new this week in tech, reading books, painting and watching horror movies. 

Currently I am intrigued by Web3 and trying to understand what's the hype about!
